# class attributes are defined directly in the class body and are accessed using the class name like--Student.name
# class attributes are shared by all instances of the class
#object attributes are instance attributes that are specific to each object

#there two things in the class . one is data and another is methods
# data is the attributes of the class and methods are the functions of the class

# Easiest way to understand methods is methods are functions that belongs to a object

# static method

# static methods are methods that belong to the class rather than an instance of the class
# they are defined using the @staticmethod decorator
# static methods do not take self or cls as the first parameter
# they can be called on the class itself or on an instance of the class
# they are used for utility functions that do not require access to instance or class data
# they can be called without creating an instance of the class
# they can be used to perform operations that are related to the class but do not require access to instance or class data
# they can be used to create factory methods that return instances of the class

#abstract 
# ABSTRACT CLASS IN PYTHON
# ------------------------
# An abstract class is a base class that cannot be used to create objects directly.
# It is meant to be inherited by other classes.
# Abstract classes can have regular methods and abstract methods.
# Abstract methods do not have any code in them â€” they just define what a method should look like.
# Any class that inherits from an abstract class must provide its own version of the abstract methods.
# Abstract classes are used to show only the important features to the user
# and hide the internal details of how things work.hide implementaion details
# To create an abstract class, use the 'abc' module and the @abstractmethod decorator.

# Example:
# from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
#
# class Animal(ABC):
#     @abstractmethod
#     def make_sound(self):
#         pass
#
# class Dog(Animal):
#     def make_sound(self):
#         print("Bark")
#
# dog = Dog()       # This works
# animal = Animal() # Error: Cannot create an object from an abstract class

#more aesy code to undertand:
class Car:
    def __init__(self):
        self.acc = False
        self.brk = False
        self.clutch = False

#Encapsulation
# ENCAPSULATION IN PYTHON
# -----------------------
# ENCAPSULATION IN PYTHON
# -----------------------
# Encapsulation means wrapping data and the functions that work on that data
# into a single unit, which is called an object.
# It helps to hide the internal details of how an object works,
# and only shows what is necessary to the outside world.
# This keeps the data safe and makes the code easier to use and maintain.
